statfilter
==========

This is a very simple Unix style filter, that reads file names (or
directory names) on STDIN (or command line), applies a configured set of
stat() filtering rules to each file, and prints the matching files or
directories on STDOUT.

This is useful, for example, in shell scripts where you want to filter out
certain files from the output of a command like 'dpkg' based on what type
of file it is (i.e. select only names that are directories).
